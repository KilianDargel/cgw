# Tutorials

The tutorials should guide you through the parts of the configuration and explain
common settings.

If you just want to get a small explanation about an already known parameter
or want to look up settings, which are normally not changed and consideren implementation
detail, please consider the [Reference](../reference/README.md).

The tutorial will not explain the architecture of the configuration itself.
To get more background on how it is structured and what concept it is based on,
please read the [Concepts part](../concepts/README.md).

If you already know, how to do the basics and want to get a model up and running quickly,
please have a look at the [How Tos](../how-tos/README.md).

The tutorial is split in diffent parts depending on the topic,
so please klick on the link to go further.
